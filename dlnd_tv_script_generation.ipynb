It started yeilding loss below 3.5 around 4th epoch and each epoch took an appreciable amount of time though a bit greater than hyperparameters in 1st experiment. As the model converged greatly I tuned the parameters again.\n",
    " Conclusion drawn: Greater sequence lengths yeild good reuslts.\n",
    "3. sequence_length=20,epochs=20,hidden_dim=756,n_layers=5 and keeping rest hyperparameters same. This model was taking time to train for each epoch. This was due to larger number of hidden_dim and n_layers. Also the onverging was not that good as compared to parameters in experiment 2.\n",
    "Conclusion drawn: The hidden_dim,n_layers and sequence length must not be increased simulatneously. This makes model to converge slowly and moreover each epoch takes more time.\n",
    "4. Lowering down the number of hidden_dim to 256 showed me a good converge but not as good as with 512. So I preferred to keep it 512.\n",
